GO3D overview
=============

go3d/assets - Asset data encoded with go-bindata

go3d/glu - OpenGL utility wrapper functions [depends on gl]
	- Program : program and associated uniforms
	- Texture : code to load texture from image
	- VertexArray: set of vertices and elements
	- UniformBuffer: uniform buffer wrapper
	- Polar : utils for spherical polar coords

go3d/mesh - Mesh drawing routines [depends on glu assets gl]
	- Mesh : VertexArray and associated metadata
	- set of built in shapes
	- Material : interface type for substance that can be rendered
	- Unshaded, Diffuse, Reflective: base material types
	- set of built in materials

go3d/scene - Scene graph routines [depends on mesh glu]
	- Object : interface type for each component
	- Item  : mesh and associated data for rendering
	- Group : list of Objects, may contain groups
	- View : defines the view parameters and projection matrix
	- Camera : interface type to generate the view matrix
	- Light : interface type for directional and point lighs

--TODO--
- point of view camera
- optimise render process
- additional examples: bouncing ball, temple scene
- shadow mapping
